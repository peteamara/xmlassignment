<audience>Before you start writing your blog, it’s best to narrow down a list and figure out what your blog is going to be about. Know firsthand what your passion is, and how you want to articulate that passion online. It would be a good idea to network online with people whom share similar interests with yourself, or arrange to meet in person with other like-minded individuals, and find out about how they got started with their own blog, and apply it to your own personal blog.
    You also want to make sure how wide or narrow the scope of your subject is. Instead of focusing on the general view of a topic, it might be a good idea to narrow the topic of your blog to something that is more suited to your passions and general perspective. Having this mindset will allow you to feel more comfortable, and allow the information to come out more freely in your writing.
